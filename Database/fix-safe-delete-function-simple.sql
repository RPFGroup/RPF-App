-- ðŸ”§ FIX SAFE DELETE FUNCTION - SIMPLE VERSION
-- ============================================================
-- This script fixes the safe_delete_project_type function to properly
-- handle foreign key constraints by deleting activities first
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 1: DROP AND RECREATE SAFE DELETE FUNCTION
-- ============================================================

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS safe_delete_project_type(TEXT);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION safe_delete_project_type(
    p_project_type_name TEXT
)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
    activity_count INTEGER;
    total_activities INTEGER;
    result JSON;
BEGIN

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_activities
    FROM project_type_activities
    WHERE project_type = p_project_type_name;
    
    -- Count active activities
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO activity_count
    FROM project_type_activities
    WHERE project_type = p_project_type_name
    AND is_active = true;
    
    -- If has ANY activities, delete them first, then delete project type
    IF total_activities > 0 THEN
        -- Delete ALL activities first (this removes foreign key constraint)

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 2: CREATE ALTERNATIVE DISABLE FUNCTION
-- ============================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION safe_disable_project_type(
    p_project_type_name TEXT
)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
    activity_count INTEGER;
    result JSON;

    UPDATE project_types
    SET is_active = false,
        updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE name = p_project_type_name;
    
    -- Disable all activities

        'activities_affected', activity_count

END;

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 3: ADD COMMENTS
-- ============================================================

COMMENT ON FUNCTION safe_delete_project_type(TEXT) IS 
'Safely deletes a project type and ALL its activities. Use this for complete removal.';

COMMENT ON FUNCTION safe_disable_project_type(TEXT) IS 
'Safely disables a project type and its activities without deletion. Use this to preserve data.';

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 4: TEST FUNCTIONS
-- ============================================================

-- Test the functions exist
SELECT 'âœ… Created safe_delete_project_type function' as status;
SELECT 'âœ… Created safe_disable_project_type function' as status;

-- ============================================================
-- COMPLETION MESSAGE
-- ============================================================
