## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as project owner or have admin rights.

### Issue: "Column already exists"
**Solution:** This is fine! The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS`.

### Issue: "Timeout"
**Solution:** Run smaller sections separately. Break the ALTER TABLE into multiple statements.

### Issue: "Application not showing data"
**Solution:** 
1. Restart Next.js dev server
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Check console for errors
