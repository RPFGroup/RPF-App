-- üîÑ RESTORE DELETED PROJECT TYPES AND FIX CASCADE DELETE
-- ============================================================
-- This script restores deleted project types and fixes
-- the delete behavior to handle activities properly
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 1: IDENTIFY ORPHANED ACTIVITIES
-- ============================================================

-- Show project types that exist in activities but not in project_types
SELECT

ORDER BY activity_count DESC;

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 2: RESTORE DELETED PROJECT TYPES
-- ============================================================

-- Restore project types that have activities
INSERT INTO project_types (name, code, description, is_active, usage_count)
