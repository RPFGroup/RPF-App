## 🔍 **If Still Not Working:**

### **Check These Specific Logs:**

#### **1. Database Update Success:**
```
✅ Permissions updated successfully: [{permissions: Array(22), ...}]
🔍 Updated user permissions length: 22
```
**If this shows 22, database update is working.**

#### **2. Data Fetch Success:**
```
📊 User with email hajeta4728@aupvs.com: {permissions: Array(22), ...}
🔍 Target user permissions length: 22
```
**If this shows 22, data fetch is working.**

#### **3. State Update Success:**
```
🎯 selectedPermissions state changed to: Array(22)
```
**If this shows 22, state update is working.**

#### **4. UI Update Success:**
- Modal shows 22 permissions selected
- Table shows 22 permissions count
- No need to close/reopen modal

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Specific Issues:**

### **If Database Shows 22 but Table Shows 9:**
- **Issue**: Table calculation logic
- **Check**: Console log "🔍 Permission count calculation for hajeta4728@aupvs.com"
- **Should show**: `finalCount: 22`

### **If Table Shows 22 but Modal Shows 9:**
- **Issue**: Modal state synchronization
- **Check**: Console logs starting with "🔄 EnhancedPermissionsManager"
- **Should show**: `selectedPermissions state changed to: Array(22)`

### **If Modal Shows 22 but Changes Don't Save:**
- **Issue**: Save process
- **Check**: Console logs starting with "🔄 Updating permissions"
- **Should show**: `✅ Permissions updated successfully`
